**Bank Account Overview Insights**

1. **Account Growth**: The bank has a total of 16,383 accounts, indicating steady growth in the account base. However, this number is lower than expected considering the country's growing population and economic expansion.
2. **Personal vs. Non-Personal Accounts**: There is a slight imbalance between personal and non-personal accounts (8911:7472). This could be an indication that the bank is attracting more individuals with personal accounts rather than corporate clients.
3. **Negative Balance Accounts**: 1282 accounts have negative balances, suggesting that customers have overdrafted their accounts. This may indicate a higher risk for the bank and necessitates closer monitoring of customer account activity.
4. **Zero-Balance Accounts**: There are 732 zero-balance accounts, indicating that some customers maintain minimal or no balance in their accounts.

**Customer Distribution Insights**

1. **Nationality Distribution**: The nationality distribution shows that Nepal dominates the customer base (16339 out of 16383), followed by a small number of international customers from various countries.
2. **Residency Distribution**: The residency distribution indicates that most customers reside in Nepal (16341 out of 16343). However, there is a noticeable presence of international residents (US, IN, SA, etc.) with a relatively smaller proportion compared to their national counterparts.
3. **Cross-Border Customers**: Only 37 customers are categorized as cross-border customers, suggesting that the bank has an insignificant share of international clients.

**Recommendations**

1. **Increase Account Growth Rate**: To sustain growth and attract more corporate clients, the bank should focus on marketing efforts targeting businesses and increasing its network of branches.
2. **Monitor Negative Balance Accounts**: The bank should maintain a closer eye on customers with negative balances to prevent potential losses and implement measures to encourage responsible account management.
3. **Expand International Presence**: To capitalize on Nepal's growing economic opportunities, the bank should invest in marketing efforts targeting international clients and explore ways to increase its presence in neighboring countries.
4. **Optimize Branch Network**: The bank's branch network should be optimized based on customer demand, with a focus on providing more services and branches in key business areas.

**Next Steps**

1. Conduct a deeper analysis of the customer demographics to identify potential trends and opportunities for growth.
2. Review the bank's marketing strategies and assess their effectiveness in attracting new customers.
3. Investigate the causes behind the low number of cross-border customers and consider implementing targeted marketing campaigns to increase this share.

By focusing on these areas, the bank can better understand its customer base, identify growth opportunities, and develop targeted strategies to improve account growth, reduce risk, and expand its international presence.
